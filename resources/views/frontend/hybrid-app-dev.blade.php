        <h2>Our Hybrid app development <span>process</span> </h2>
        <p>Hybrid app development uses web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create cross-platform mobile apps. A hybrid app is usually developed in the following steps:   </p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-prtl-d-inner hybrid-services">
        <div class="w-prtl-d-block">
          <div class="shop-slider-hd">

            <div><h3>Determine the project requirements</h3></div>
          </div>
          <p> The app's goals, target audience, functionality, and features must be defined before development begins.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-prtl-d-block">
          <div class="shop-slider-hd">
            <div class=" shop-slid-img"><img class="portal_black_icon" src="https://cdn.masterinfotech.com/assets/images/hybrid/wireframe-hybrid.png" alt="Design the user-interface"></div>
            <div><h3>Design the user-interface  </h3></div>
          </div>
          <p>  User interface (UI) design should be intuitive, attractive, and user-friendly. The app's UI and UX may be visualized through wireframes and prototypes.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-prtl-d-block">

            <div><h3>Develop the app's front-end & back-end</h3></div>
          </div>
          <p> The back end of an application is where the app's APIs, databases, and server-side logic live, whereas front-end development includes UI code and back-end integration.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-prtl-d-block">

            <div><h3>Testing & debugging </h3></div>
          </div>
          <p>The programme is thoroughly tested for functionality, speed, and security. This process tests and optimizes the app's features, bugs, and performance.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-prtl-d-block">

            <div><h3>Deployment & Maintenance</h3></div>
          </div>
          <p>Once the app has been developed and tested, it's time to publish it to the app store. This involves creating an account with the app store(s), preparing the app for submission, and submitting it for review.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-prtl-d-block">

            <div><h3>Support & Maintenance</h3></div>
          </div>
          <p>After the app has been published, its important to continue maintaining it by fixing bugs, adding new features and also ensuring that it remains compatible with the latest operating system.

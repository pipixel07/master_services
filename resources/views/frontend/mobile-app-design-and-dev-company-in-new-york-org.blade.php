application development?</label>
				  <div class="answers">
					<p>We mostly use open source languages like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for front-
end development and PHP and JavaScript for back-end development. For the 
majority of mobile applications, our developers use React Native, but depending 
upon budget and how quickly you need it, we use Cordova or PhoneGap to 
support both iOS & Android app development processes.
For web apps’ back-end development, our mobile app developers New York use a
PHP framework like Laravel or JavaScript with NodeJS. We also use front-end 
layout frameworks like bootstrap, material design, and Ant design, integrated 
with React or Angular.</p>

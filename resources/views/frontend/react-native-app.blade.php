            <h3>Time & money saving</h3>
            <div class="hr"><hr></div>
            <p>Since 95% or more of the code is cross-platform here, developers must create only one app but make two. This reduces app development time & money.
            </p>
        </div> 
        <div class="indus-list">             
          <h3>Excellent performance</h3>
          <div class="hr"><hr></div>
          <p>The functionality of react native apps is incomparable because they use GPU instead of CPU. This makes them much faster than hybrid cross-platform systems.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div class="hr"><hr></div>
          <p>Native mobile apps can be used even when there is no network connection. Once the connection is reestablished, an app can use local data to sync with the server.
          </p>
        </div>  
        <div class="indus-list">             
          <h3>Effortless execution</h3>
          <div class="hr"><hr></div>
          <p>Native mobile apps have a performance advantage due to their platform-specific code. So this code directly translates to faster and more reliable options.

          <h3>Use of advanced features</h3>
          <div class="hr"><hr></div>
          <p> External data and services can be accessed from the user's device using native APIs. Consequently, native APIs for contact lists, calendars, media libraries, and more make adding new features and improve your app.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indus-list">             
          <h3>Update apps faster</h3>
          <div class="hr"><hr></div>
          <p> It took significantly longer to provide updates to apps since developers had to redo the development process for each app individually. React native has simplified that procedure.

          <h2>An overview of native mobile app development services   </h2>
          <p>Native App Development is optimal for generating a significant impression on the online market with your company's plans and offerings. These apps are platform-specific apps that utilise device-specific hardware and software.
            By doing so, the app can make the most of the platform's resources, leading to increased efficiency, decreased waiting times, and an overall smoother experience for the end user.                           </p>

              <p>There are several challenges that are faced by developers while developing wearable app development. So let’s have a look at the challenges of developers:


                •	Defining the purpose of the wearable app
                •	Creating an intuitive user interface 
                •	Security of data 
                •	Determining the speed 
                •	Compatibility of the application

            <div class="faq-drawer__content">
              <p> No, there are no hidden charges for wearable app development. You just need to pay the amount that is listed in the agreement. </p>

          <div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
            <div class="faq-drawer__content">
              <p> The wearable device application development cost is entirely based on the unique needs. Our experts see the wearable device type, project, scope, and many more. Other factors that are considered are testing strategy, 
                tech stack, UX/UI design complexity, and post launch support.  </p>
